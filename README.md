# DB AppMaker 4

**DB AppMaker** is a powerful automation tool that can generate **Android** and **iOS** mobile apps quickly from **MySQL**, **PostgreSQL**, **SQLite**, **Microsoft SQL Server** and **Oracle** databases. It helps you build native-feeling mobile apps using web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. DB AppMaker can save you tons of development time by generating scripts for an app in seconds, with the app users can list, view, add, edit and delete database records on your server. The generated scripts are highly customizable and can be opened in your own tools for further development. DB AppMaker can also output your app in release mode (requires Android SDK tools) as .aab or .apk file for publishing to Google Play.
